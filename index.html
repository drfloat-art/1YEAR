        Hello babe this it my second paragraph and this is me basically just saying how much this year has been amazing being with you just because your the most amazing girl ever and forever will be😡😡😒❤️. Basically ever since you fell in love with me I finally had a reason to continue living and not give up on living because I knew that you needed care and love that you never gotten before and I told my self "I'll love her how I always wanted to be loved because she really deserves it" but then what I didn't expect is for you to actually give me true love for the first time in my life and that really made me so happy babe🙁❤️. Your the spark in my world🙁❤️. Like I can't even explain how amazing it's really been being with you and actually having you love me.veing with you and having you in my life has really made me want to keep on living and to make you happy and make us have a happy family in the future. Like sometimes in my head I think about where I'm gonna take you and what spots we are gonna go on dates at and how you'll enjoy them bc I have alot in stored for us to do😭😭❤️. Babe do you remember the first time we ever called? 😭
        Well it wasn't really an actual call bc I was outside. Doing stuff while you and Angie were chatting 😭😭, but it made me alot bc I got to hear you speak and just hearing you speak really brings joy to me even tho I rare hear it now bc you refuse to speak to me 😒😔💔. But like I said I'll still wait for you to be comfortable babe 😭. Babe and I also wanna say sorry for the negative days we have 😔. Ik most of the time it's me bc of my overthinking and that's why I want to apologize. Because I would never ever ever want you to have a bad day and having a bad day just because of me when I'm really wanting you to have a good day everyday because of me. And I know your going through a lot right now and I wish I was there to comfort you and take you outside to clear your mind up from the things you don't speak about. Ik your strong babe l, ik my baby is strong and that she won't let these things fully bring her down, I'm always here to support you and follow you in your dreams. If someone tries to bring you down I'll bring you up after I bring them down. I would never make anyone hurt you mentally and physically babe bc your mines to protect 
        and your heart is as precious as gold and sweet like sugar. Your heart is mine to have, protect and never let anyone hurt. I love you so much babe and I want you to be with me forever and ever because I really freaking love you so much and I want you to be with me forever, I want you to be the lady I would tell people is my wife. I want you to be the one that I wake up to, I want you to be mine and my everything forever babe 🙁❤️❤️. I love you so so so so much babe 😭❤️❤️❤️.HAPPY 1 YEARRRR ANNIVERSARY BABEEE I LOVE YOU AND CHERISH YOU FOREVERRRRRRRR😭❤️❤️❤️ AND ILL FOREVER BE HAPPY WITH YOU😭❤️❤️❤️😊
